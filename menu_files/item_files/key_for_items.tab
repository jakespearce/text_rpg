ID	Item Name	Context	Quantity	Submenu	KeyItem

ID: ID is the item's index number, see http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_items_by_index_number_(Generation_I)

Submenu: Determines whether using the item will bring up the submenu OUTSIDE OF BATTLE ONLY 1= yes 0 = no eg. Using the Bike item doesn't bring up the submenu when outside of battle. Inside of battle, using the bike item doesn't come up with a submenu it just says 'Now is not the time to use this.'

TODO: Add a column indicating whether the item is a key item. Key items don't display a quantity in the inventory.

KeyItem= 1 = Key item. Key items can't be tossed. When a key item is selected it is instantly used (if it can be used)
