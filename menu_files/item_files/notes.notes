Notes on item Use and Context:

When we run Use on an item we read that item and save the item's context value. We then compare the item's allowed contexts with a context value that we read from somewhere else.
This somewhere else should be some sort of global configuration file. For example, if the player is in a battle, the global context value will read '2' for battle. If we're in a cave, it could be '4'. 
Depending on the context that the Use script reads, the Use script will behave differently.
Eg. If our global config file tells the Use script that the context is '2' for battle (ie. the player is in the middle of a fight), then Use on the Bicycle item will fail, as the Bicycle item record has a context value of 3.
Items that can be used in any context (those items that have a context value of '1') can be used no matter what the global config file says.
